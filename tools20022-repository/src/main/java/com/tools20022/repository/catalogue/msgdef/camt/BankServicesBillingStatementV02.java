/**
 * Scope The BankServicesBillingStatement message is used to send from a
 * Financial Institution (FI) to its wholesale customers (corporations,
 * governments, institutions, etc.), information describing the FIâ€™s billing of
 * services rendered in the form of an electronic statement in a standardised
 * format. The BankServicesBillingStatement is a periodic (usually end of month)
 * recounting of all service chargeable events that occurred during a reporting
 * cycle, typically a calendar month, along with detailed tax and currency
 * translation information. Account balance information, although strongly
 * recommended, is not required. Usage The BankServicesBillingStatement message
 * is designed to provide details related to invoices (or an advice of debit)
 * which a financial institution may supply to its customers. The
 * BankServicesBillingStatement is not expressly designed to be an invoice, nor
 * to replace invoices currently in use. The message may be used as an invoice
 * by agreement between the sender and the receiver. No regulatory or
 * legislative requirements were considered when creating this message standard.
 * Users of the BankServicesBillingStatement message are cautioned to be aware
 * of any regulatory or legal requirement for invoices before replacing existing
 * invoices. The BankServicesBillingStatement message can supply the detail
 * supporting separate invoices or debits but it is not the invoice or advice of
 * debit of record. The BankServicesBillingStatement message must accurately
 * reflect all the charge and tax related events that occurred during the
 * calendar month and how the FI and taxing authorities were compensated for
 * these events. The BankServicesBillingStatement does not ask the financial
 * institution to revise its established pricing and billing procedures. How,
 * when and what the customer is actually charged for remains in place. The
 * BankServicesBillingStatement message asks the financial institution to
 * aggregate and report what actually happened during the calendar month. The
 * BankServicesBillingStatement message is intended for use with the ISO 20022
 * Business Application Header.

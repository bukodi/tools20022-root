/**
 * This Message Definition Report provides the description of the ISO15022
 * Variants of the current version of the Settlement And Reconciliation message
 * definitions. These variants have been developed by SWIFT to help ISO 20022
 * users who need to be interoperable with the ISO 15022 Settlement And
 * Reconciliation message types. This has been done by restricting the ISO 20022
 * message components wherever necessary to ensure compatibility with the
 * equivalent fields in ISO 15022. For more information, please refer to the ISO
 * 15022 Variants Business Justification that is available at
 * http://www.iso20022
 * .org/documents/BJ/BJ096/ISO20022BJ_15022_variants_v3_with_comments.doc
 * 
 * These variants are maintained by SWIFT. Requests for changes to these
 * variants should be addressed directly to SWIFT.

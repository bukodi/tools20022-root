/**
 * A message that provides a standard means for banks to periodically advise
 * their wholesale clients or correspondent banks bank service fees, taxes and
 * average balances. Electronic in form, the Bank Services Billing (BSB) is
 * designed to augment or replace the corresponding paper billing statement or
 * to introduce a billing statement if there is no paper statement available.
 * 
 * BSB is intended to be equally relevant for use regardless of where bank
 * accounts reside. By design BSB is intended to cover the EU, Singapore, USA,
 * and other countries. It needs to be recognized however that bank billing and
 * related market practice is complex and diverse across multiple geographies.
 * It is possible that revisions to the standard will be required to accommodate
 * market practice (or changes to practice) not accommodated by the standard at
 * the time of its creation. A maintenance process will be available to address
 * future revisions to the standard which may be required.

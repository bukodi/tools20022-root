/**
 * Scope An account servicer sends a SecuritiesMessageCancellationAdvice to an
 * account owner to inform of the cancellation of a securities message
 * previously sent by an account servicer. The account servicer/owner
 * relationship may be: - a central securities depository or another settlement
 * market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants - an agent
 * (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or - a
 * custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a
 * broker/dealer.
 * 
 * Usage The previously sent message may be: - a securities settlement
 * transaction confirmation - a report (transactions, pending transactions,
 * allegements, accounting and custody securities balance) - a allegement
 * notification (when sent by mistake or because the counterparty cancelled its
 * instruction) - a portfolio transfer notification - an intra-position movement
 * confirmation - a transaction generation notification The previously sent
 * message cannot be a status advice message (any). If a status advice should
 * not have been sent, a new status advice with the correct status should be
 * sent, not a cancellation advice. The message may also be used to: - re-send a
 * message previously sent, - provide a third party with a copy of a message for
 * information, - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information
 * using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
 * 
 * ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence This ISO 20022 message is reversed engineered
 * from ISO 15022. Both standards will coexist for a certain number of years.
 * Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is
 * restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users.
 * Compliance to these rules is mandatory in a coexistence environment. The
 * coexistence restrictions are described in a Textual Rule linked to the
 * Message Items they concern. These coexistence textual rules are clearly
 * identified as follows: “CoexistenceXxxxRule”.

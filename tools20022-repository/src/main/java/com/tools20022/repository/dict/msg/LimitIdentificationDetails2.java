/**
 * Cash management feature limiting the maximum risk a party accepts to take
 * with respect to a counterparty or a set of counterparties. A risk management
 * limit is either bilateral, ie, for a counterparty, or multilateral, ie, for a
 * set of counterparties or all other members in a system.The limit may also
 * apply to sponsored members, ie, indirect members. In principle, a risk
 * management limit is calculated on the net position between two members and is
 * expressed as a credit or debit limit, from the point of view of the party
 * setting the limit.
